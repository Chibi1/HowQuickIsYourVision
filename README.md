# How Quick Is Your Vison

### This is a game that will test how quickly one can register information. The game will begin by randomly displaying a number between 0 and 9 on the display for a certain amount of time, before the number disapears again. The player will then have to state what number was displayed. If correct, the player will then progress to the next level, where the number will be displayed for a ahorter amount of time. 
### The duration for which the number is shown will be shorter and shorter for each successive round the player succesfully completes until the player selects the wrong number, and then the game will end, displaying the duration used in the last level played.
